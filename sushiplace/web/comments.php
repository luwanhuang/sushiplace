							Local friends have recommended we try this place for years. Finally went and were sadly disappointed. The place is dirty and run down looking. Wait staff likes to point out large color pictures of menu items to help you choose. It would help if they wiped the cobwebs away from in front of at least one picture. Food was OK...

							Friends took us to this establishment in this liitle town at the end of the highway. We all,had some variation of sushi - not a particular favorite of mine. But I found the whole experience quite decent though not as good as a well-prepared steak. The place was clean, the staff friendly.

							We'd heard good things about this restaurant and were extremely disappointed. Restaurant was packed at the end of a lunch rush and host was rude, servers snapped at us before we even sat down. Restaurant was unclean with food all over the floor and even the walls. The sushi rolls were imaginative, but did not deliver on taste or presentation....

							Have been all over the world, tasting foods at the finest restaurants. To be frank, Sushi Rock is truly an experience in dining above all others. The food is so original and unique, combining flavor and texture as I've never tasted. The ingredients are organic, home grown and fresh caught. So delicious I went back for four days straight, wanting.
